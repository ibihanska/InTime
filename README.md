> A Kanban board using ASP.Net Core and Materialize CSS


### Function

This web application allows the creation of new categories as main boards. Within each board are category columns that separate a list of cards.

Create your own boards by submitting a query in the `Add Board` form. Then add a few cards, which will then add three default columns named: "Todo, Doing, and Done". Move or drag the cards into their respective columns using jQuery's `draggable()` method from the Drag & Drop JavaScript library.

## Software Stack and Tools

The application was built using the following:

- ASP.Net Core 3.1
- jQuery & Ajax for dragging Cards
- Entity Framework Core as the ORM
- Materialize CSS v1.0

## Additional Packages
